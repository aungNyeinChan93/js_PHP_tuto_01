The **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** is a key concept in object-oriented programming, and it applies to PHP as well. The principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. This ensures that the subclass can stand in for the superclass without altering the expected behavior of the program.

Here's a simple example in PHP to illustrate the Liskov Substitution Principle:

<?php

class Bird {
    public function fly() {
        echo "Flying";
    }
}

class Sparrow extends Bird {
    // Inherits the fly method from Bird
}

class Ostrich extends Bird {
    // Ostriches can't fly, so this violates LSP
    public function fly() {
        throw new Exception("Ostriches can't fly");
    }
}

function makeBirdFly(Bird $bird) {
    $bird->fly();
}

$bird = new Sparrow();
makeBirdFly($bird); // Outputs: Flying

$bird = new Ostrich();
makeBirdFly($bird); // Throws Exception: Ostriches can't fly
?>
```

In this example, substituting `Ostrich` for `Bird` would break the program because `Ostrich` cannot fly, violating the LSP. To adhere to LSP, you might need to rethink the class hierarchy or the methods involved.
