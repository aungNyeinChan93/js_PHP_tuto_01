The **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** is one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented design. It states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions¹².

### Applying DIP in PHP

Here's a practical example to illustrate the Dependency Inversion Principle in PHP:

#### Without DIP
```php
<?php

class Lamp {
    public function turnOn() {
        echo "Lamp is on";
    }
}

class Button {
    private $lamp;

    public function __construct(Lamp $lamp) {
        $this->lamp = $lamp;
    }

    public function press() {
        $this->lamp->turnOn();
    }
}

$lamp = new Lamp();
$button = new Button($lamp);
$button->press(); // Outputs: Lamp is on
?>
```

In this example, the `Button` class depends directly on the `Lamp` class, which violates the DIP.

#### With DIP
```php
<?php

interface Switchable {
    public function turnOn();
}

class Lamp implements Switchable {
    public function turnOn() {
        echo "Lamp is on";
    }
}

class Button {
    private $device;

    public function __construct(Switchable $device) {
        $this->device = $device;
    }

    public function press() {
        $this->device->turnOn();
    }
}

$lamp = new Lamp();
$button = new Button($lamp);
$button->press(); // Outputs: Lamp is on
?>
```

In this improved example, the `Button` class depends on the `Switchable` interface rather than the `Lamp` class directly. This way, both the `Button` and `Lamp` classes depend on the abstraction (`Switchable`), adhering to the DIP¹².

### Benefits of DIP
- **Decoupling**: High-level modules are not tightly coupled with low-level modules, making the system more flexible and easier to maintain.
- **Reusability**: High-level modules can be reused with different low-level modules that implement the same interface.
- **Testability**: It becomes easier to test high-level modules by mocking the dependencies.

By following the Dependency Inversion Principle, you can create more robust, maintainable, and flexible PHP applications.
