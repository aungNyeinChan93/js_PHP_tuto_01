Polymorphism is a core concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This enables methods to perform different actions based on the object they are called upon, enhancing code flexibility and reusability.

### Implementing Polymorphism in PHP

#### Using Abstract Classes
Abstract classes can define methods that must be implemented by any subclass. This allows different subclasses to provide their own implementation of the method.

```php
abstract class Person {
    abstract public function greet();
}

class English extends Person {
    public function greet() {
        return "Hello!";
    }
}

class German extends Person {
    public function greet() {
        return "Hallo!";
    }
}

class French extends Person {
    public function greet() {
        return "Bonjour!";
    }
}

function greeting(array $people) {
    foreach ($people as $person) {
        echo $person->greet() . "<br>";
    }
}

$people = [new English(), new German(), new French()];
greeting($people);
```

In this example, the `greet` method is implemented differently in each subclass, but they all share the same interface defined by the `Person` abstract class¹.

#### Using Interfaces
Interfaces can also be used to achieve polymorphism. Any class that implements an interface must provide implementations for all of its methods.

```php
interface Shape {
    public function draw();
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    public function draw() {
        return "Drawing circle.";
    }
}

class Square implements Shape {
    public function draw() {
        return "Drawing square.";
    }
}

function drawShapes(array $shapes) {
    foreach ($shapes as $shape) {
        echo $shape->draw() . "<br>";
    }
}

$shapes = [new Circle(), new Square()];
drawShapes($shapes);
```

Here, both `Circle` and `Square` classes implement the `Shape` interface, allowing them to be used interchangeably in the `drawShapes` function².

### Advantages of Polymorphism
- **Flexibility**: Allows for writing more generic and reusable code.
- **Maintainability**: Adding new classes that implement the same interface or extend the same abstract class does not require changes to existing code.
- **Reduced Coupling**: Promotes loose coupling between classes, making the system more modular and easier to manage.
